# BlueStamp-Tricorder
This is the code from my Star Trek Tricorder Project. There are two files: one for the main code, and one exclusively for the thermal camera; this is because the Arduino Nano only has a limited amount of memory. The project can be viewed here: http://bit.ly/Mark-BlueStamp-Tricorder
